# CNN Image Classification Project: Cats vs Dogs

## 1. Installation

This project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook. To get started, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `os`

You can install these using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## 2. About the Project

The main goal of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can classify images as either cats or dogs. CNNs are a powerful tool for image classification because they automatically learn relevant features from the images during training. Here’s what the project involves:

- Creating a CNN model from scratch.
- Preprocessing images to ensure the data is ready for the model.
- Training the model and measuring its performance.
- Visualizing the results and predictions on sample images.

### Questions to Explore:
1. How well can a CNN classify images of cats and dogs?
2. What challenges come up when building and training a CNN for this task?

## 3. Files in This Project

The repository contains the following files:

- **`CNN for Image Classification.ipynb`**: This is the main notebook that includes all the code for the project. It covers data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.
- **Datasets**: You’ll need a dataset of labeled images of cats and dogs.

## 4. Results and Insights

After training, the CNN model performs well at distinguishing between cats and dogs. Here are some key takeaways:

- The model effectively learns important features from the images for binary classification.
- Preprocessing steps like resizing and normalizing the images are critical for good results.
- Visualizing predictions gives insight into where the model succeeds and where it struggles.

## 5. Acknowledgments
